--- Spreadsheet specifications

First of all, we do not seriously consider support for languages other than Japanese. I don't think it's a problem...
Each sheet is assumed to have a character header line and a Roman character corresponding line alternately filled in from the first line.
Please refer to japanese.ods etc. for details.
I think you get the general idea.


--- Symbol sheet

This is reserved (case insensitive) as a special sheet name for symbols.
This Symbol sheet is output separately from other sheets.

Because it is necessary to separate symbols from others due to input judgment processing.
The specifications are as follows.

You can omit the Symbol sheet if it is not needed.
